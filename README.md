# Javascript Programming Task

### In order to be considered for this position, you must complete the following steps.
*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most to complete.*


### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require some Javascript knowledge. Jquery and/or React would be helpful as well. 

## Task
##### Base functionality
- Fork this repository (or google how if you don't know how).
- Create a *source* directory.
- In the *source* directory, create a simple html page that has a simplified version of the Gmail Compose new email experience
![Gmail](http://picpaste.com/pics/2XRzyIck.1424206971.png =350x)
  - A compose button, when clicked will open a compose window
  - A compose window with 4 parts
    1. To - a simple input with placeholder text
    2. Subject - an simple input with placeholder text
    3. Body - A div with content-editable 
    4. Send button - On click should console log the To, Subject and Email body in the console
  - The compose window should be able to be able to be minimized and closed like in Gmail
  - A new compose window should be able to be opened, shifting over the any existing ones - No logic required for overflow

##### Styling/CSS
- Compose button doesn't matter, just a div or button will do
- Make the compose window look as much like Gmail's as possible

##### Approach
- Use ReactJS (if you know it), Jquery, or plain Javascript to construct the compose window and its behaviour
- Feel free to structure files (css,cs,html) however you like. We like organization.
