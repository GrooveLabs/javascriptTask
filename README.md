# Javascript Programming Task

### In order to be considered for this position, you must complete the following steps.
*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most to complete.*

### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require Javascript and Jquery proficiency. React would be helpful as well if you know it.

## Task
##### Base functionality
1. Fork this repository (or google how if you don't know how).
2. Create a *source* directory.
3. In the *source* directory, create a simple html page that has a simplified version of the Gmail Compose new email experience

  1. A compose button, when clicked will open a compose window
  2. A compose window with 4 parts
    1. To - a simple input with placeholder text
    2. Subject - an simple input with placeholder text
    3. Body - A div with content-editable 
    4. Send button - On click should console log the To, Subject and Email body in the console
  3. The compose window should be able to be able to be minimized and closed like in Gmail
  4. A new compose window should be able to be opened, shifting over the any existing ones - No logic required for overflow

##### Styling/CSS
- Compose button doesn't matter, just a div or button will do
- Make the compose window look as much like Gmail's as possible

##### Approach
- Use ReactJS (if you know it) or jQuery to construct the compose window and its behaviour
- Structure your code and files (css,cs,html) as if this were a real project with other collaborators
- If you're running low on time, focus on functionality first, css second.
